Todo list
=========

Here is  a list of things to do before the final release of dropit.

* Triggering and conflict management: when a note is synced in two 
  couchdb instances, and updated in both places, we are in a conflict 
  state. CouchDB provide a way to handle this, but application have to 
  imlement a part of this procedure in order to make this work.

* Have a simple CRUD system for notes. (Add/Delete/Edit/Show)
* Handle tags
* Write couchdb views for tags
* Make a simple presentation of the project
