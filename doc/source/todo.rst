Triggering and conflict management:
    Javascript function to handle conflicts.

        * get the conflicts (write the view) 
        * change the older one to a "revision".
        * make the newer one point to the older one.

        Think it can have more than 2 conflict documents at the same time.
        conflicts.rst
